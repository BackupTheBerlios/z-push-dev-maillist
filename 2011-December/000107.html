<PRE>Hi,

&#160;

I understand your optimizations. But still, in a normal sync request GetMessageList should be called only once per folder (during Diffbackend-&gt;Config()).

It would of course be called several times in a row if the synchronization is split up (e.g. 100 items per request) ? so you would have 20 requests/calls to synchronize 2000 contacts.

Could you elaborate that a bit further what is happening?

&#160;

Greetings,
Sebastian Kummer

&#160;Hello


Kolab stores events and contacts in imaps folder. For optimization reason i check the status of the imap folder and if nothing is new i resend


the same list that i stored the last time that somethings moved. It works well in normal state, but at the first sync when i ve got a lot of entry (eg


contacts &gt; 2000 entries) z-push seems to call getMessageList in 2 or 3 times and the problem is that i record the state of my folder too early


I need to store the state of my imap folder only when the synchro is finished (at the very end of the sync)


&#160;


&#160;The &quot;trigger which you could use to perform ?an ending procedure? .&quot; should be solve the problem.


&#160;

Hi Alain,


&#160;


I do not completely understand what you mean.


&#160;


When using the diffbackend there will be always a list of changes to be processed. This is done by comparing two lists of IDs, the ones currently returned by GetMessageList() with the ones from the last synchronization.


On the first sync, the ?last time? list is just empty, while the output of GetMessageList() represents all messages which are new and should be sent to the device.


&#160;


The individual changes are then processed one-by-one.


&#160;


The diffbackend is always be aware of the state of the sync (DiffState obj).


You could call the backend to do any administrative tasks.. But I do not really understand the use-case for that.


The diffbackend is not aware of the ?end-of-synchronization?, means when the processor decided to end the request (e.g. 10 (from XX) exported).


&#160;


In Z-Push 2 this would be possible, as there at the end of the request eg. device relevant data is saved.


We plan to add a possibility for the backend to write own data, then you would have a trigger which you could use to perform ?an ending procedure? .


The only other way I can think of atm is a destructor.

Hello&#160;



I ve an issue with the first sync when there are too much entries, the backend can t know if this is the end of the sync or not and couldnt make some



status jobs



&#160;



There is a way for the diffbackend do know the state of the sync ?&#160;



&#160;



Regards
