Hi Manfred,

thanks a lot for your explanations.

&gt;<i> Z-Push releases basically have the following structure:
</I>&gt;<i> MajorRelease.MinorRelease.VersionCounter
</I>
Sure, that is common release engineering practices (and usually referred to as 
Major.Minor.Patchlevel). However my list of releases was more to illustrate 
that the naming is not consistent: For 1.5 we had beta1 and beta2. For most 
releases we only had one beta and this was randomly called beta or beta1 or 
beta2. Same with the alpha releases and release candidates. How can you 
release a beta when there was no alpha?

For major releases we plan several alpha and beta versions as well as RCs before a final release. For minor releases we plan one or several beta versions but sometimes the changes aren't so heavy, so that there is only one beta which explains that some betas have beta1 and some only beta in their names. Generally there's only one RC but if there were changes after a RC release, which we consider so important to have in the upcoming version, there might be a RC2. Final version is identical with the last RC.

Generally we follow Zarafa's release schema.
Don't get me wrong: I am not in the position to point fingers at you, because 
my release of Kolab 2.3 was a very bumpy ride, too, but for z-push this seems 
to happen constantly. And while Kolab is a product of it's own, z-push is a 
framework heavily used by third parties - so it is crucial to have 
reliability.

The roadmap with features and planed release dates is available publicly at least since January and we update it regularly, so everyone involved can react to it and give us feedback. Until now there was none, so I assume everyone is fine with it. As far as I know Sebastian has sent several emails to Alain regarding the integration of Kolab backend but haven't received any response.
&gt;<i> Z-Push 2.0 is a new major release because we have changed a lot of things
</I>&gt;<i> in code, the API has changed, state and device management have changed and
</I>&gt;<i> there are new features. The 1.5.X versions will only receive bug fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> After Z-Push 2.0 is stable and released, support for 1.X releases will be
</I>&gt;<i> discountinued after transition period.
</I>
How long will this transition period last?

This is not defined yet.
&gt;<i> The roadmap and release schedule are available at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://z-push.sf.net/roadmap.">http://z-push.sf.net/roadmap.</A> Currently there is no API available. The
</I>&gt;<i> goal of early releases is to get the feedback about the functionality as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as possible in order to have as few bugs in the stable release as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>
I think it is hard to get feedback if there is no description of what has 
changed. Alain will have to dig through the code in order to port the Kolab 
backend to the new API - without even having documentation about the API. And 
there is no guarantee the API won't change again.

I don't expect an alpha to fully work and to be bug free, but usually an alpha 
is feature complete and the API is stable. The roadmap however lists features 
that need to be added and some of them look as if they will affect the API.

This being said I am not sure that this alpha is something that is worth 
testing for third parties, so I a not overly optimistic, that you will get the 
desired feedback. I am convinced that a little more reliability and 
predictability will benefit both Zarafa as well as other developers.

I have to point out that Z-Push is primarly a product for the end-users which might be extended by third parties. So, our main expectation is to receive as much feedback as possible for various devices.

But for Z-Push 2 we have also done a lot of refactoring which will ease the life of developers. We will publish the changes and the API for the developers after the API is stable. 

If you take a look at the roadmap, you will see that these Z-Push 2 alpha releases are actually milestones.
Kind regards,
Christoph
