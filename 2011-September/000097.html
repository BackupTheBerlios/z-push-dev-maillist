Hi Manfred,

thanks a lot for your explanations.

&gt;<i> Z-Push releases basically have the following structure:
</I>&gt;<i> MajorRelease.MinorRelease.VersionCounter
</I>
Sure, that is common release engineering practices (and usually referred to as 
Major.Minor.Patchlevel). However my list of releases was more to illustrate 
that the naming is not consistent: For 1.5 we had beta1 and beta2. For most 
releases we only had one beta and this was randomly called beta or beta1 or 
beta2. Same with the alpha releases and release candidates. How can you 
release a beta when there was no alpha?

Don't get me wrong: I am not in the position to point fingers at you, because 
my release of Kolab 2.3 was a very bumpy ride, too, but for z-push this seems 
to happen constantly. And while Kolab is a product of it's own, z-push is a 
framework heavily used by third parties - so it is crucial to have 
reliability.

&gt;<i> Z-Push 2.0 is a new major release because we have changed a lot of things
</I>&gt;<i> in code, the API has changed, state and device management have changed and
</I>&gt;<i> there are new features. The 1.5.X versions will only receive bug fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> After Z-Push 2.0 is stable and released, support for 1.X releases will be
</I>&gt;<i> discountinued after transition period.
</I>
How long will this transition period last?

&gt;<i> The roadmap and release schedule are available at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://z-push.sf.net/roadmap.">http://z-push.sf.net/roadmap.</A> Currently there is no API available. The
</I>&gt;<i> goal of early releases is to get the feedback about the functionality as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as possible in order to have as few bugs in the stable release as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>
I think it is hard to get feedback if there is no description of what has 
changed. Alain will have to dig through the code in order to port the Kolab 
backend to the new API - without even having documentation about the API. And 
there is no guarantee the API won't change again.

I don't expect an alpha to fully work and to be bug free, but usually an alpha 
is feature complete and the API is stable. The roadmap however lists features 
that need to be added and some of them look as if they will affect the API.

This being said I am not sure that this alpha is something that is worth 
testing for third parties, so I a not overly optimistic, that you will get the 
desired feedback. I am convinced that a little more reliability and 
predictability will benefit both Zarafa as well as other developers.

Kind regards,
Christoph
