<PRE>Hi all,
&#160;
after discovering that the HTC Android Mail Sync Application that comes from HTC doesn't sync propper I've investigated a bit more the Z-Push code. I've found out (for whatever reason) that the FolderSync took after discovering the amount of 79 changes took 22 seconds to go through the Synchronize Process. The device itself seems to have a hardcoded 15 seconds timeout and therefor crashed all time during FolderSync (it simply rerequested 3 times with Sync Key 0). With Zarafa-Gateway in use the whole process takes below 5 seconds. After optimization of the PHPHierarchyImportProxy class I managed to speed up the sync to 12 Seconds which is right now enough and brings the device into sync. 
&#160;
The changed class is attached to this eMail. Changes are mainly from if clause to switch/case combination and moving parts that should not change between folders that get synced into the class init function. Comments are very much appreciated.
&#160;
Another idea would be to restrict the initial sync only to the main folders of the mailbox and afterwards send all the changes or send them by levels until the lowest level reached. This could at least safe time during initial sync. Unfortunately I was unable to setup restriction for Folders in ics Backend. Maybe the reason is that this is not being expected in php-mapi for folders, just for items... Please comment on this since I cannot find a reason in MS ICS Mapi documentation.
&#160;
Best regards
&#160;
Andreas
