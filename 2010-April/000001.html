<PRE>Hi everybody,
welcome Christoph,

good to see that more and more people are getting involved.

Right now we are gathering features and working on the spec for Z-Push 2.0. It will contain several improvements, especially in advanced logging, AS14 compatibility, advanced provisioning and also a new scheme for file and backend distribution (in separate folders like /usr/share, /var/lib/ and configs in /etc). This also includes a different backend directory scheme in svn. 

Focus is right now the modifications to the backend structure so we can open the svn for your commits. This will happen in the next couple of days. After this we can set the permissions accordingly in SVN.

This will probably lead to some minor changes also in your code, as the including method will be different that it is today.
If possible, please send me your code in an informal way. Especially what kind of settings you need in your config file. That way we have all necessary information.
That's also the reason why I have not yet answered to your email, Alain.

Furthermore I would ask you all to subscribe to the Z-Push mailing list:

Kind regards,

Hi Sebastian,

Please allow me to introduce

	Christoph Wickert, Senior Engineer, Kolab Systems

to the round. He'll be working on QA &amp; testing of the Z-Push connector with 
Alain's development team, which has already made great headway in the past 
weeks, so it is about time now to start bringing things together.

The BerliOS accounts that should be added from our side are

	alain_abbas
	cwickert

Once you've added them we can start merging our efforts.

Best regards,
Georg
