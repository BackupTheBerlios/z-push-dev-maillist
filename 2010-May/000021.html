<PRE>Hi all,

a short update on this. In the meanwhile the Kolab backend got submitted in the svn, but is not being included by the code at the moment. We are working on this and it can then be used normally with the trunk (single checkout).

A little bit in general about backends and objects:
The way this is implemented is related to how ActiveSync works. AS is very near to how MAPI sees the world. That is the reason why all kind of objects (emails, tasks, appointments and contacts) are just treated as &quot;the same&quot; by a single backend. Only on the edges of the backend (when accessing the storage) these objects are treated differently. Each object type is based on the folder type it is in.

If you look at the general imap backend, you can synchronize your email to an imap server. Same applies to the vcard backend which works with local vcard files. But it is not possible to &quot;combine&quot; both in a single installation.

To archive what Jelle proposed, backend have to be split up, but then later joined together again. This is not trivial, but was actually done before.

In he &quot;bas-branch&quot; you will find a so called CombinedBackend[1] with a specialized config[2].
It allows you to define a set of folders and by which backend they are handled.
It's a really nice approach which unfortunately was never pushed forward. I'm still looking for a developer interested in taking care of that and willing to investing some time to get this stable and nicely handled for future versions. Candidates? :)

Kind regards,
Sebastian Kummer

I read the above information but could not find implementing 
information for setting up a test/production system to make the 
synchronisation work.

&gt;<i> Then follow the instructions from

</I>
I checkout the svn at 
<A HREF="https://kolabzpush.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kolabzpush">https://kolabzpush.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kolabzpush</A> and skimmed 
the code. It seems the kolab.php is one big php file for mail, 
contacts and calendar synchronisation.

Would it be possible to split this in seperate backends for imap, ldap 
and caldav? I also see a lot of specif defines for the Kolab server. 
Would it be possible to make this generic so that my 
postfix/dovecot/caldav/ldap server can communicate with the backends?

If there are additional resources required to make this happen please 
say so.

Thanks in advance,

Best regards,

Jelle
