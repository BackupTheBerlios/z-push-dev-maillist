<PRE>Hi Christoph,

that is indeed a simple fix. We will put that in 1.4.1RC which is to be released today.

Just to explain a little bit: this is a compatibility issue of Maemo phones. As in the spec the AS client has to announce how many items maximum it wants to receive. Not announcing this the device will receive ALL objects of a certain folder (that can be thousands). That most certainly breaks the phone.

With the patch the maxItems is always limited to 100, if the device doesn't announce it. The patch is not quite in the right place, we will fix it a bit differently, but with the same effect.

A ticket has been created: <A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/mantis/view.php?id=173">https://developer.berlios.de/mantis/view.php?id=173</A>

Cheers,
Sebastian

Assunto: [Z-Push-dev] z-push and the N900 with firmware 1.2 (patch inside)

A user reported that his N900 stopped working with (kolab)-z-push after he 
upgraded the firmware to pr1.2. Later he reported success with the patch from

<A HREF="http://kolab.org/pipermail/kolab-users/2010-July/011672.html">http://kolab.org/pipermail/kolab-users/2010-July/011672.html</A>

Can anybody please look at the patch? To me it looks trivial, but I don't know 
if it has negative side effects.

Regards,
Christoph
