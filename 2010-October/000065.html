<PRE>Hey,

&#160;

the preferred way is of course changing mapi_folder_copymessage() or to implement an additional function to get the new ids. Implementing &quot;an own move in php&quot; doesn't sound like t a clean approach, also because it will probably be an issue for ICS.

Unfortunately we have to go through an entire Zarafa release cycle until this functionality will be available for z-push.
&#160;

I check that.

&#160;

Greetings,

Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,
&#160;
welcome - I will open a ticket for this but the question is if we should fix this in Z-Push (by creating our own copy message in ICS Backend that copies all props from source message to&#160;new&#160;message in destination folder and afterwards deletes the source message or if mapi_folder_copymessage will be changed the way that new message id is being returned (prefered way - but&#160;this could mean mapi incompatibility) or if there could be a new function that will return the&#160;ids of messages that are result of&#160;last move/copy?
&#160;
Best regards
&#160;
Andreas

Hi Andreas,





thx for your research. What you say makes sense, some weeks ago I fixed the same issue for the IMAP Backend (it also did not return the new message id).





THe reason why a new id is assigned is, that in MAPI a move is always a copy &amp; delete. 


If I remember correctly, the underlaying problem is, that mapi_folder_copymessage() doesn't return the id of the new message in the destination folder.

There is also no easy way to &quot;look into the folder and discover the new id&quot;.

Could you open a new ticket for this?

I will have a look later.

&#160;

Cheers,

Sebastian

Hi Sebastian, hi Manfred,
&#160;
while having a few minutes I tried to investigate the issue regarding message duplication in case both folders (src and dest) are marked for sync. My results of this investigation and steps used are the following:
1.) Take any message you have on your mobile device and move it from folder (i.e. Inbox) to another folder you keep in sync (i.e. testbla).
2.) Sync the device with Z-Push
3.) Find that message in folder you moved it in exists twice.
&#160;
The reason for this is the ImportMessageMove in ics Backend and function being used. It just returns true or false but not the new message id. Therefor Z-Push sends just the same value for DestMsgId that is has for SrcMsgId. The question is just why the mapi_folder_copymessage assigns a new message id although the message should be moved according to flags. In case the new message id is a wished behaviour we have to change our way to move an item within Z-Push. In case it is a problem in Zarafa Server it should be fixed in there asap since in case you work with the wrong item (and you don't know which item is the right one in folder) there will be further errors (i.e. during smartforward / smartreply). 
&#160;
Would be nice to get an update on this how this issue should be fixed according your opinion. 
&#160;
Best regards
&#160;
Andreas
