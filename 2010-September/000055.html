<PRE>Hi Merijn,
&#160;
nice to see you here at the list ;-) Could you please be a bit more precise which clients you've identified that keep the connections open? Is it a specific brand or&#160;a specific client? You speak about Emulator in your thread - emulators sometimes not behave like real devices you mention now in your email. Furthermore question is if you're using a proxy server within your scenario. How many devices you have connected at your system btw?
&#160;
In general the ActiveSync Session is a long HTTP Connection. Maximum up to 60 minutes if I remember the specs right. In case i.e. a proxy server terminates the connection because it ran into a timeout the result could be like you explained. Another possibility could be that the device looses connection because of the reason that the user is going by car through a tunnel / switching GSM Cells. This could result in a connection break and maybe your system / provider&#160;keeps socket open for a while because of sysctl settings. 
&#160;
Well - but first of all lets see if we can bring things together prior changing the code. Let's see if there is&#160;a system behind this behaviour.
&#160;
Best regards
&#160;
Andreas

Subject: [Z-Push-dev] Lot's of connections to the server



Hi!

Can I get some attention on this forum topic?

<A HREF="http://z-push.sourceforge.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=891">http://z-push.sourceforge.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=891</A>


I have some very serious problems with servers reaching the MaxClients setting because some phones keep a lot of connections open. Netstat shows them as CLOSE_WAIT and Apache mod_status with W (Sending reply).

I hope someone can help us!

Best regards,
Merijn
