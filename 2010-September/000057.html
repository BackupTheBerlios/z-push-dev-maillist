<PRE>Hi Merijn,

in case what you wrote in 2nd paragraph is true, the issue seems to be not Z-Push related. It is more httpd / config related. In my response I've asked about Proxy Server involved. I would like to extend this question a bit more regarding how the Z-Push httpd server is being integrated in your network infrastructure. I need to ask you this since I did never observe a problem like this on my or other systems I've installed Z-Push on.

Best regards

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

Thank you for your response!

The server is a Debian Etch server with php 5.2.0 and there are no special modules or extensions installed. There are about 10 devices connected to the server and it seems that it are iphones that cause problems. I contacted one of them and he has an Iphone 3G with iOS 4.0.1 and connects through gprs and wifi when it's available.

The strange thing about the multiple connections that a lot of the PID's are not logged in the debug.txt file so it seems that PHP never executes on these requests. But apache keeps the connection alive and netstat shows the connection in state CLOSE_WAIT. It's not just a connection break that causes this because those requests will never end and a restart of apache is the only solution.

Best regards,

Merijn&#160;

Hi Merijn,
&#160;
nice to see you here at the list ;-) Could you please be a bit more precise which clients you've identified that keep the connections open? Is it a specific brand or&#160;a specific client? You speak about Emulator in your thread - emulators sometimes not behave like real devices you mention now in your email. Furthermore question is if you're using a proxy server within your scenario. How many devices you have connected at your system btw?
&#160;
In general the ActiveSync Session is a long HTTP Connection. Maximum up to 60 minutes if I remember the specs right. In case i.e. a proxy server terminates the connection because it ran into a timeout the result could be like you explained. Another possibility could be that the device looses connection because of the reason that the user is going by car through a tunnel / switching GSM Cells. This could result in a connection break and maybe your system / provider&#160;keeps socket open for a while because of sysctl settings. 
&#160;
Well - but first of all lets see if we can bring things together prior changing the code. Let's see if there is&#160;a system behind this behaviour.
&#160;
Best regards

Andreas

Subject: [Z-Push-dev] Lot's of connections to the server



Hi!

Can I get some attention on this forum topic?

<A HREF="http://z-push.sourceforge.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=891">http://z-push.sourceforge.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=891</A>


I have some very serious problems with servers reaching the MaxClients setting because some phones keep a lot of connections open. Netstat shows them as CLOSE_WAIT and Apache mod_status with W (Sending reply).

I hope someone can help us!

Best regards,
Merijn
