I'm sorry, but I think you are wrong. Zarafa releases are now always called
&quot;zcp-&lt;VERSION&gt;.tar.gz&quot; and the directory inside is &quot;zcp-&lt;VERSION&gt;&quot;. Example
is: <A HREF="http://download.zarafa.com/community/final/6.40/6.40.8-27223/sourcecode/">http://download.zarafa.com/community/final/6.40/6.40.8-27223/sourcecode/</A>

&gt;<i> Nevertheless, I do understand that and why a uniform link is important
</I>&gt;<i> for you.
</I>
I think you misgot me (and I maybe misgot Christoph), but I am looking for
a file name of the software archive that is like GNU (and nearly everybody
else out there) is doing for ages: &lt;NAME&gt;-&lt;VERSION&gt;.&lt;ARCHIVE&gt; - which is
then containing a directory being named &lt;NAME&gt;-&lt;VERSION&gt;. Note that version
is the real software version as in 1.0 or 1.5.3, but not contains any VCS/
SCM information, such as 1.5.3-685.

Having a uniform link like <A HREF="http://z-push.sf.net/latest-stable">http://z-push.sf.net/latest-stable</A> does not work
out for me at RPM Fusion (for Fedora), because that URL shall always return
the same archive and is subjected to never change. Once you release a new
version, the URL would point to another archive that no longer matches the
checksums etc.

One of the benefits is, that I'm able to simply bump the version inside of
the spec file and fire a rebuild without the need to lookup the new VCS/SCM
version at the download page.

Aside of this, it is common practice for ages as well that an Open Source
upstream not abuses the version number or a part of it by using a dash,
because normally only the downstream uses the dash: to separate the
upstream version and it's (local) packaged build number very clearly...

Christoph might want to add something more here, but I generally believe he
has a similar view, if I did not misgot him.

By the way...that's also something that Zarafa is still doing wrong at
their official RPM packages, even I pointed out that multiple times in the
past. RPM release tag is something downstream only and might contain
upstream's VCS/SCM number as a part of it, but not exclusively as it is
case now. Nevertheless their upstream tarball has a proper versioning.

</I>
You know that Zarafa didn't really announce the Community Portal so far? I
just know by accident that this Zarafa Community Portal exists...


Greetings,
