Greg Conway a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am running z-push on a Kolab 2.3.4 server (using Horde), and am 
</I>&gt;<i> experiencing various issues using Z-push and iPhones (IOS5). I thought 
</I>&gt;<i> I would ask some basic questions here first off, to determine whether 
</I>&gt;<i> these problems exist for other z-push users, or just for me (and my 
</I>&gt;<i> Kolab server!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1/ all calendar events that are created within Horde (on Kolab server) 
</I>&gt;<i> that then sync to the iPhone are in timezone Europe/Berlin. I am in 
</I>&gt;<i> Europe/London, and the server is set to Europe/London (with UTC 
</I>&gt;<i> enabled or disabled, I get the same results). Events that are created 
</I>&gt;<i> on the iPhone are set in what appears to be the correct timezone 
</I>&gt;<i> (London), but after editing them in Horde they change to timezone Berlin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did find php.ini was hard-coded to Europe/Berlin, but after amending 
</I>&gt;<i> this the timezone problem remains - although this did correct the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem of my php logs being one hour out! I also found my debug.txt 
</I>&gt;<i> log was one hour out. Within z-push config.php I added a line to set 
</I>&gt;<i> the default timezone to Europe/London, and this corrected my zpush 
</I>&gt;<i> logs. Sadly neither of these fixes resolved the calendar timezone 
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The datas are sent to the iphone in Utc
things that you can check :
1) the setting of your iphone ( the timezone setting)
2) The system timezone. The events are converted from XML to activesync 
via the Kolab::Format Library. i don t remember that php.ini variable is 
used.
3) the debug.txt time is the local system time. seems that your OS is 
not in the good timezone. (you can check in /kolab/var/apache/log witch 
time you have)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2/ If I create or edit all day events within Horde, when they sync 
</I>&gt;<i> down to the iPhone they lose the &quot;all day&quot; flag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has the effect that all day events do not sit in the top of the 
</I>&gt;<i> calendar &#8211; instead they occupy the entire day on the iPhone calendar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Initially all such events were also one hour out, causing them to run 
</I>&gt;<i> from/to 23:00 spread over two days (which I've read is a common 
</I>&gt;<i> problem with Outlook) but after modifying php.ini/config.php they at 
</I>&gt;<i> least now run from 00:00 to 00:00 when looking at the calendar view. 
</I>&gt;<i> However - if I display an event on the iPhone it then says it runs 
</I>&gt;<i> from 1:00 to 1:00, with timezone Berlin again!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Seems the same problem than below
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3/ Then, beyond the timezone issues, I have issues accepting meeting 
</I>&gt;<i> requests on the iPhone itself. I am unable to accept meeting requests 
</I>&gt;<i> in most cases, and when a confirmation button appears and I managed to 
</I>&gt;<i> add the event to my calendar, the usual emails are not sent, etc. The 
</I>&gt;<i> appointments work fine on using Thunderbird, Horde, Outlook, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not tested , for me it can t work for the moment
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I initially dismissed this as the client on the iPhone (as all other 
</I>&gt;<i> clients seem to work), and was prepared to start looking for a more 
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive Email client, when one of our users pointed out the 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality works fine on the iPhone with the iCloud calendars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody else have these issues, or are these old issues that have 
</I>&gt;<i> been released with the latest version of z-push?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate that it does sound like my timezone is one hour out, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it&#8217;s definitely correct. Horde is also set to the correct time zone, 
</I>&gt;<i> and Emails come through correctly. Maybe there&#8217;s somewhere else I&#8217;ve 
</I>&gt;<i> overlooked that I could look for an incorrect timezone setting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greg Conway.
