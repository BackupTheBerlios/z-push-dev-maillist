<PRE>Hi Alain,

Thanks for the response. 

&gt;<i> The datas are sent to the iphone in Utc
</I>&gt;<i> things that you can check :
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the setting of your iphone ( the timezone setting)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The system timezone. The events are converted from XML to activesync
</I>via the Kolab::Format Library. i don t remember that php.ini variable is
used.
&gt;<i> 3) the debug.txt time is the local system time. seems that your OS is not
</I>in the good timezone. (you can check in /kolab/var/apache/log witch time you
have)

1/ The iPhone is set to London. 
2/ The (CentOS 5.7) system time zone is set to London, within
/etc/sysconfig/clock and also having copied
/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Europe/London to /etc/localtime. Also if I run
setup it shows the correct timezone with UTC enabled. I assume from your
reply that it is correct to enable UTC?
3/ The debug.txt output now shows the correct time. I've checked the files
within /kolab/var/apache/log and they also now show the correct system time.
All these files were one hour out to start with, before I modified (z-push)
config.php and php.ini. Now everything is okay with these logs.

If I switch off calendar time zone on the iPhone then appointments are (now)
very nearly correct - the remaining issue is that all day events are not
shown as all-day events (with the all-day flag checked) - they are shown as
calendar entries lasting from 00:00 to 00:00.

(If I switch on calendar time zone support then upon editing an event the
time is one hour out, but fortunately I can stick with calendar time zone
support switched off!)

I will post to the Kolab user group as you suggest - really I just wanted to
check whether these issues existed in z-push regardless of the back end,
before I started with the questions to the Kolab users group!

Particularly I was curious as to whether the &quot;all-day&quot; flag is correctly set
for other users when syncing a device from some back-end server (in my case
Kolab) to the iPhone, or do such events become calendar entries from
00:00-00:00, and that's just the way it is with z-push?!

Thanks again,

Greg.
