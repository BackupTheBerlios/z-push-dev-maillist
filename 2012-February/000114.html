<PRE>Hi all,

 

I am running z-push on a Kolab 2.3.4 server (using Horde), and am
experiencing various issues using Z-push and iPhones (IOS5). I thought I
would ask some basic questions here first off, to determine whether these
problems exist for other z-push users, or just for me (and my Kolab server!)

 

1/ all calendar events that are created within Horde (on Kolab server) that
then sync to the iPhone are in timezone Europe/Berlin. I am in
Europe/London, and the server is set to Europe/London (with UTC enabled or
disabled, I get the same results). Events that are created on the iPhone are
set in what appears to be the correct timezone (London), but after editing
them in Horde they change to timezone Berlin. 

 

I did find php.ini was hard-coded to Europe/Berlin, but after amending this
the timezone problem remains - although this did correct the problem of my
php logs being one hour out! I also found my debug.txt log was one hour out.
Within z-push config.php I added a line to set the default timezone to
Europe/London, and this corrected my zpush logs. Sadly neither of these
fixes resolved the calendar timezone problems.

 

2/ If I create or edit all day events within Horde, when they sync down to
the iPhone they lose the &quot;all day&quot; flag.

 

This has the effect that all day events do not sit in the top of the
calendar - instead they occupy the entire day on the iPhone calendar.

 

Initially all such events were also one hour out, causing them to run
from/to 23:00 spread over two days (which I've read is a common problem with
Outlook) but after modifying php.ini/config.php they at least now run from
00:00 to 00:00 when looking at the calendar view. However - if I display an
event on the iPhone it then says it runs from 1:00 to 1:00, with timezone
Berlin again!

 

3/ Then, beyond the timezone issues, I have issues accepting meeting
requests on the iPhone itself. I am unable to accept meeting requests in
most cases, and when a confirmation button appears and I managed to add the
event to my calendar, the usual emails are not sent, etc. The appointments
work fine on using Thunderbird, Horde, Outlook, etc. 

 

I initially dismissed this as the client on the iPhone (as all other clients
seem to work), and was prepared to start looking for a more comprehensive
Email client, when one of our users pointed out the functionality works fine
on the iPhone with the iCloud calendars.

 

Does anybody else have these issues, or are these old issues that have been
released with the latest version of z-push?

 

I appreciate that it does sound like my timezone is one hour out, but it's
definitely correct. Horde is also set to the correct time zone, and Emails
come through correctly. Maybe there's somewhere else I've overlooked that I
could look for an incorrect timezone setting?

 

Thanks for any help! 

 

Regards,

 

Greg Conway.
